🏦 Bank Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
A Python-based interactive application that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. The project uses Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers and provides an interactive Streamlit interface for visualization and manual transaction verification.

✨ Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understand the dataset and check for missing or duplicate values.

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis of features.

Data Preprocessing
Feature scaling using StandardScaler.

Skewness mitigation with PowerTransformer.

Handling imbalanced datasets using undersampling techniques.

Machine Learning Models
Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Model comparison with accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and AUC.

Interactive Streamlit Dashboard
Visualize dataset statistics and distributions.

Compare model performance with ROC curves and confusion matrices.

Manual transaction verification: predict if a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.
